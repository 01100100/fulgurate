ABOUT
-----

Simple spaced repetition flashcard software. Flashcards are stored in a simple text format and the code is small enough to be easily modifiable. The spaced repetition algorithm is SM-2 (http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm). See the python files or the man pages for usage of the programs. See the SM-2 website for more details on the algorithm and the scale of the user self-evaluation input.

DATA
----

Flashcards have two parts, corresponding to the top and bottom of a card. The input to fulgurate-import should contain tab-separated two columns for the top and bottom fields respectively. The flashcard files themselves (produced by fulgurate-import) are similar but include the card state.

EXAMPLE
-------

An example of common usage is as follows:
  fulgurate-import example.tsv example.cards # Create a flashcard set
  fulgurate-run example.cards # Run the flashcards in the terminal
  fulgurate-show-schedule example.cards # Show the current scheduling for the cards

The included example.tsv file is sample card data consisting of a few Chinese-English dictionary entries from CC-CEDICT.
